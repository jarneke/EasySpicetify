# EasySpicetify
A small python based program that basically just makes a gui to controll [spicetify](https://spicetify.app) commands

Allot of Chat-GPT was used as i dont have/ bearly have any knowledge of Python, but by doing this ive learned the syntax (still prefer typescript)

To use, download the python script, edit the "your_root_folder" variable (at the top of the code) to fit your file system, and then run the script
